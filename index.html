  <div id="top-banner"><h1>A first web page</h1></div>
  <div id="main-info"><p>This is my very first webpage. I am just testing a bunch of different things, <br>
  maybe everything i want to try will end up working out. <br>
    In the mean time, while i actually do some stuff; here are the lyrics to Toto by Africa:<br></p>
<p id="song">I hear the drums echoing tonight<br>
But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation<br>
She's coming in, 12:30 flight<br>
The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation<br>
I stopped an old man along the way<br>
Hoping to find some long forgotten words or ancient melodies<br>
He turned to me as if to say, "Hurry boy, it's waiting there for you"<br>
It's gonna take a lot to take me away from you<br>
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do<br>
I bless the rains down in Africa<br>
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had<br>
The wild dogs cry out in the night<br>
As they grow restless, longing for some solitary company<br>
I know that I must do what's right<br>
As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti<br>
I seek to cure what's deep inside, frightened of this thing that I've become<br>
It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you<br>
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do<br>
I bless the rains down in Africa<br>
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had<br>
Hurry boy, she's waiting there for you<br>
It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you<br>
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do<br>
I bless the rains down in Africa<br>
I bless the rains down in Africa<br>
(I bless the rain)<br>
I bless the rains down in Africa<br>
(I bless the rain)<br>
I bless the rains down in Africa<br>
I bless the rains down in Africa<br>
(Ah, gonna take the time)<br>
    Gonna take some time to do the things we never had</p></div>
  <div id="commentary">
  As you can see, to the right we can see a random block of text, 
  typed up by an idiot explaining some random stuff,
  including the lyrics to <span class="italic">AFRICA</span> by <span class="italic">TOTO</span>
