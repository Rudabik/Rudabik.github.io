  <div id="top-banner"><h1>A first web page</h1></div>
  <div id="main-info"><p>This is my very first webpage. I am just testing a bunch of different things, <br>
  maybe everything i want to try will end up working out. <br>
    In the mean time, while i actually do some stuff; here are the lyrics to Toto by Africa:<br></p>
<p id="song">I hear the drums echoing tonight<br>
But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation<br>
She's coming in, 12:30 flight<br>
The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation<br>
I stopped an old man along the way<br>
Hoping to find some long forgotten words or ancient melodies<br>
He turned to me as if to say, "Hurry boy, it's waiting there for you"<br>
It's gonna take a lot to take me away from you<br>
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do<br>
I bless the rains down in Africa<br>
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had<br>
The wild dogs cry out in the night<br>
As they grow restless, longing for some solitary company<br>
I know that I must do what's right<br>
As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti<br>
I seek to cure what's deep inside, frightened of this thing that I've become<br>
It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you<br>
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do<br>
I bless the rains down in Africa<br>
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had<br>
Hurry boy, she's waiting there for you<br>
It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you<br>
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do<br>
I bless the rains down in Africa<br>
I bless the rains down in Africa<br>
(I bless the rain)<br>
I bless the rains down in Africa<br>
(I bless the rain)<br>
I bless the rains down in Africa<br>
I bless the rains down in Africa<br>
(Ah, gonna take the time)<br>
    Gonna take some time to do the things we never had</p></div>
  <div id="commentary">
  As you can see, to the right we can see a random block of text, 
  typed up by an idiot explaining some random stuff,
  including the lyrics to <span class="italic">AFRICA</span> by <span class="italic">TOTO</span>
    I think that I am going to put in some <span class="italic"> good </span> music below.
    <span id="italic tiny">*note the different border<span>
  </div>
  <div id="commentary-2" "italic">
    All I need is one<br>
One old man is enough<br>
Babe, you got it wrong<br>
Just turn your fears into trust, to trust<br>
Where'd the love go?<br>
When all is said and done<br>
Hey now, put your hands in the air<br>
I'ma go through your stuff<br>
Where'd the love go?<br>
Put the running into run<br>
You asking me to stay<br>
But I never met a girl I could trust<br>
You're sayin' those words like you hate me now (wo-oah)<br>
Our house is burning when you're raisin' hell (wo-oah)<br>
Here in the ashes your soul cries out (a-a-ah)<br>
But don't be afraid of these thunderclouds<br>
These thunderclouds, oh, no<br>
These thunderclouds, oh, no, no<br>
All I need is love (da-dum, dum, dum)<br>
All I need is a word (da-dum, dum, dum)<br>
All I need is us (da-dum, dum, dum)<br>
You turned nouns into verbs, to verbs<br>
Where did love go?<br>
When all is said and done<br>
Hey now, put your hands in the air<br>
I'ma go through your stuff<br>
Where did love go?<br>
You put the running into run<br>
You're asking me to stay<br>
But I never met a man I could trust<br>
You're sayin' those words like you hate me now (wo-oah)<br>
Our house is burning when you're raisin' hell (wo-oah)<br>
Here in the ashes your soul cries out (a-a-ah)<br>
But don't be afraid of these thunderclouds<br>
These thunderclouds, oh, no<br>
These thunderclouds, oh, no, no<br>
These thunderclouds, oh, no<br>
These thunderclouds, oh, no, no<br>
These thunderclouds, oh oh<br>
These thunderclouds, oh oh oh<br>
These thunderclouds<br>
Ohh
